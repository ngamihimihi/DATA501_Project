\title{Constructor for em_model Object}
\usage{
em_model(data, method = "EM", distribution = "nvnorm", early_stop = list())
}
\arguments{
\item{data}{A numeric matrix with missing values (NAs). Must not be entirely missing.}

\item{method}{A character string, either \code{"EM"} or \code{"MCEM"}, which determines the algorithm to use.}

\item{distribution}{A character string indicating the assumed distribution family. Currently only \code{"mvnorm"} is supported.}

\item{early_stop}{A list to store convergence status and iteration count. Defaults to an empty list.}
}
\value{
An object of class \code{em_model} with initialized slots for parameters, history, and output.
}
\description{
In this draft package: only multivariate normal distribution is ready for testing (method = 'nvnorm')
Initializes an EM model structure with input data and placeholders
for algorithm output. Used as the primary object to pass through
the EM or MCEM pipeline.
}
\examples{
data <- matrix(c(1, NA, 3, 4), ncol = 2)
model1 <- em_model(data)
model2 <- em_model(data, method = "MCEM")
